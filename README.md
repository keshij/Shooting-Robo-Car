# Shooting-Robo-Car
This is  Wi-Fi enabled heavy load Robo car using ESP8266 with a tank shooting mechanism.
ABOUT
As we all are aware the tank mechanism and Tanish ball shooting mechanism so I combine both and develop this shooting-Robo-car.
This project describes the implementation of a Wi-Fi-enabled Robo car using ESP8266(microcontroller). In this, we can give the specific command to the robocar through an Android app (BLYNK) installed in the smartphone and enable Wi-Fi technology that helps it to control globally and locally.
On the receiving side, ESP8266 receives the command and controls the functioning of the Robocar accordingly.
The highlight of our project is the SHOOTING MECHANISM.
The shooting mechanism has the capability of covering the X and Y axis with the help of this the Robocar is able to hit the target more accurately from the static place.
